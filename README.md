### Cypress Automation Testing

This repository contains an automation testing suite implemented using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications.

#### Overview

In this project, I've created a series of automated tests using Cypress to validate the functionality of various web application features. The tests are designed to ensure the reliability and performance of the application through automated browser interactions, assertions, and validations.

#### Features

- **End-to-End Testing**: Automated tests that cover critical user flows and functionality.
- **API Testing**: Integration of API requests and validations within the test suite.
- **Shared Data Management**: Utilizes Cypress hooks (`before`, `beforeEach`) to manage and share test data across multiple test cases.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Demonstrates how to work with data and perform validations using Cypress's powerful assertions.
